# Polyvariant Flow Analysis with Higher-ranked Polymorphic Types and Higher-order Effect Operators

This is an implementation of the analysis named [Polyvariant Flow Analysis with Higher-ranked Polymorphic Types and Higher-order Effect Operators](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1863554) created by Jurriaan Hage and Stefan Holdermans. A demo of this implementation is hosted at: [http://netowork.herokuapp.com/stuff/polyvariant/](http://netowork.herokuapp.com/stuff/polyvariant/).

## Instructions
This program requires [https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs](GHCJS) since only a web user interface is supported. The program can still be compiled with GHC and loaded via GHCI. The reconstruction algorithm can be invoked with the examples of the package __Analysis.Examples__.
